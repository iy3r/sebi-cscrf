- **applicability:** [mii, qualified, mid-size, small-size, self-certification]
- **mandatory:** true

1. As part of the operational risk management framework to manage risks to systems, networks and databases from cyber-attacks and threats, REs shall formulate a comprehensive Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience policy document encompassing CSCRF. In case of deviations from the CSCRF, reasons for such deviations, technical or otherwise, shall be provided in the policy document.
2. The policy document shall be approved by the Board/ Partners/ Proprietor of the REs. The policy document shall be reviewed by the aforementioned group periodically with a view to strengthen and improve cyber resilience posture.
3. REs shall have policies (including but not limited to) with respect to asset management, patch management, vulnerability management, VAPT policy, audit policy, monitoring of the networks and endpoints, configuration management, change management, secure software development life cycle management, authentication policies, authorization policies and processes, network segmentation/ isolation policies, commissioning internet facing assets, encryption policies, PII and privacy policies, cybersecurity control management policy, asset ownership documentation, etc., and chain of command for any approval process in the organization with respect to cybersecurity. The policies shall also contain do's and don'ts in the organization with respect to usage of information assets including desktops, laptops, BYOD, networks, internet, data, etc. The aforementioned policies may form a part of RE's cybersecurity policy or may be standalone policies.

### GV.PO.G2
- **standards:** [GV.PO.S1, GV.PO.S2, GV.PO.S5]
- **applicability:** [mii, qualified, mid-size, small-size, self-certification]

4. REs shall formulate a policy for mobile and web applications and associated services with the approval of their Board/ Partners/ Proprietor. The contours of the policy, while discussing the parameters of any "new product" including its alignment with the overall business strategy and inherent risk of the product, risk management/ mitigation measures, compliance with regulatory instructions, customer experience, etc., shall explicitly include security requirements from Functionality, Security and Performance (FSP) angles.
5. All information/ data (classified as *Regulatory Data* and *IT and Cybersecurity Data*) that is consumed/ handled by REs shall be made accessible to SEBI when required. If there is any dependency on external party, REs shall facilitate information sharing with SEBI by including it in their agreement with external party.
6. The Cybersecurity Policy shall include the following process to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks associated with processes, information, networks and systems:
   a. 'Identify' critical IT assets and risks associated with such assets.
   b. 'Protect' assets by deploying suitable controls, tools and measures.
   c. 'Detect' incidents, anomalies and attacks through appropriate monitoring tools/processes.
   d. 'Respond' by taking immediate steps after identification of the incident, anomaly or attack.
   e. 'Recover' from incident through incident management and other appropriate recovery mechanism.
