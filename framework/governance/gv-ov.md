## Guidelines

### GV.OV.G1
- **standards:** [GV.OV.S4]
- **applicability:** [mii, qualified]
- **mandatory:** true

1. REs shall conduct third-party assessment (for MIIs) and self-assessment (for Qualified REs) of their cyber resilience using CCI and submit corresponding evidences to their submission authority on a periodic²⁴ basis. CCI and its calculation methodology has been attached at Annexure-K. REs shall strive for building an automated tool and suitable dashboards (preferably integrated with log aggregator) for submitting compliance of CCI. A dashboard shall be available at the time of cyber audit, onsite inspection/ audit by SEBI or any agency appointed by SEBI.

> ²⁴ Refer 'CSCRF Compliance, Audit Report Submission, and Timelines' section.

## Annexure

### Box Item 4: Cyber Capability Index

Under the guidance of SEBI's High Powered Steering Committing on Cybersecurity (HPSCCS), SEBI has developed a Cyber Capability Index (CCI) for the securities market.

The above-mentioned CCI is calculated on the basis of 23 parameters with different weightages.

Based on the value of the index, the cybersecurity maturity level of the REs shall be determined as follows:

*Table 24: Rating categories of REs based on CCI*

| SN. | Rating | Index Score |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Exceptional Cybersecurity Maturity | 100–91 |
| 2 | Optimal Cybersecurity Maturity | 90–81 |
| 3 | Manageable Cybersecurity Maturity | 80–71 |
| 4 | Developing Cybersecurity Maturity | 70–61 |
| 5 | Bare Minimum Cybersecurity Maturity | 60–51 |
| 6 | Fail | <=50 (RE has scored below the cut-off in at least one domain/ sub-domain) |

REs shall strive to build an automated tool and suitable dashboards (preferably integrated with log aggregator) for submitting CCI compliance.
