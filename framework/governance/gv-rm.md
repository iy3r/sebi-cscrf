## Guidelines

### GV.RM.G1
- **standards:** [GV.RM.S1, GV.RM.S2]
- **applicability:** [mii, qualified, mid-size]
- **mandatory:** true

1. Risk Management
   a. The design of the cyber risk management framework needs to consider the following (including but not limited to):
      i. Identification of the cybersecurity risk for the organization
      ii. Classification of identified and mapped business functions, supporting processes and information assets at risk.
      iii. Determination of risk appetite for IT and cybersecurity risks.
      iv. Definition of mitigation measures and controls to reduce the risks.
      v. Monitoring of the effectiveness of the above-mentioned measures and controls.
      vi. Evaluation of the effect of major changes and significant operational, technical or cybersecurity incident(s) on the risks.
   b. REs shall consider using latest version of ISO 27005 as a guidance on design, implementation, and maintenance of information security risk management.
   c. Risk management strategy of REs shall include (but not limited to) risk assessment, risk analysis, risk mitigation, risk monitoring and review, compliance with relevant laws and regulations, communication of risk management policies to all stakeholders, effective mitigation measures with options for compensatory controls wherever feasible, measures to reduce residual risk and ensuring that the cybersecurity risk tolerance is within acceptable limits.
   d. REs shall use metrics like (including but not limited to) MTTD, MTTR, MTTC, number of cybersecurity incidents/ intrusion attempts detected and resolved within a specific period, number of false positives and false negatives generated by cybersecurity monitoring tools, number of successful cyber attacks occurred in the past year, and how these numbers are being reduced through continuous refinement of the monitoring process for measuring their cybersecurity maturity level.
   e. REs shall periodically assess level of employee cybersecurity awareness, for e.g., through phishing test success rate, etc.
   f. REs shall undertake periodic IT asset management for functions such as number of devices on the network running end-of-life (EOL) software, number of devices no longer receiving security updates, unidentified devices on the internal network, integration of third-party devices and services into the network, etc. Further, IT asset management may also be utilized for process of managing assets' access and permissions, patching cadence, security rating, third-party security rating, number of known vulnerabilities, etc.
   g. Risk-based transaction monitoring or surveillance process shall be implemented as part of fraud risk management system across all delivery channels.

### GV.RM.G2
- **standards:** [GV.RM.S3]
- **applicability:** [mii, qualified, mid-size]
- **mandatory:** true

1. Comprehensive scenario-based testing shall be done for assessing cybersecurity risks of the RE. A sample list of possible attack scenarios and possibilities for Stock Exchanges have been attached at Annexure-E. Other MIIs and REs shall prepare their own attack scenarios as per their business model and assess their risks accordingly.

## Annexure

### Box Item 5: Cyber risk management

*Cyber risk management enables an organization to identify, prioritize, manage and monitor risks to their IT/ information systems and infrastructure. Cyber risk management is a continuous and iterative process that necessitates continuous improvement and assessment of security controls by incorporating emerging new information and responding to latest threat landscape. Cyber risk management includes:*

1. ***Identify:** Determine the threats that might affect and compromise an organization's cybersecurity. This also includes identifying cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the threats that might exploit them.*
2. ***Analyze:** Risk should be assessed with a measure of the likelihood of occurrence of a vulnerability and expected harmful impact that might result from the consequences of exploitation of the vulnerability.*
3. ***Evaluate:** Each risk should be evaluated against the threshold of acceptable risk.*
4. ***Prioritize:** High risk observations should be mitigated on priority.*
5. ***Respond:** Response to risks should be consistent with organization's Incident Response and Management Plan. Organizations may choose to treat, tolerate, terminate, transfer the risk based on their risk appetite.*
6. ***Monitor:** As cyber risk management is not a one-time activity but a continual process, organizations should monitor risks to ensure that they are below their pre-determined level of acceptable risk.*
